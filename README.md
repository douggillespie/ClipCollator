# Contact Collator

The Contact Collator module is designed to provide a common output from multiple detectors and classifiers and to provide a “one-stop” data stream summarising recent detector activity. It can be configured to take input from multiple detectors and apply data selection to those data, for example to select different types of click events from the click detector or the click train detector. When a threshold number of detections occur for within a user defined time frame, new “Contact” data are output for that detection stream.
